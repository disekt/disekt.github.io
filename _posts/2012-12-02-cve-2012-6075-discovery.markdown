[CVE-2012-6075](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6075)

Buffer overflow in the e1000_receive function in the e1000 device (hw/e1000.c) in QEMU 1.3.0-rc2 and other versions, when the SBP and LPE flags are disabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) and possibly execute arbitrary kernel level guest code via a large packet.
